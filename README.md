Java Project
The Online Quiz Application is a console-based quiz system. Users will be presented with a series
of questions, choose answers, and receive feedback on their performance. The project will cover
fundamental concepts such as data structures, user input handling, and conditional statements.
Through this, you'll gain valuable experience in Java development.
